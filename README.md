velib_python
============
This is the general Victron Energy python library. Today it only contains code
that is related to dbus and the Color Control GX. Note that busitem.py,
dbusitem.py and tracing.py are deprecated. See vedbus.py instead.

Also note that the migration from the previous types to vedbus.py is still in
the works.
