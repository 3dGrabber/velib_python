Below is an instruction on how to modify existing CCGX to work with Pubnub.py and JSON. This
will be added to standard CCGX distro soon, and then we'll remove this file again.

On ccgx

  mkdir /usr/lib/python2.7/json

On linux machine

  wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/simplejson/simplejson-3.3.3.tar.gz

  scp simplejson-3.3.3.tar.gz root@192.168.51.37:~

  scp /usr/lib/python2.7/decimal.py root@192.168.51.37:/usr/lib/python2.7
  scp /usr/lib/python2.7/numbers.py root@192.168.51.37:/usr/lib/python2.7
  scp /usr/lib/python2.7/json/*.py root@192.168.51.37:/usr/lib/python2.7/json

Then switch to CCGX (ssh root@192.168.51.37)

  tar -xfr simplejson-3.3.3.tar.gz
  cp ./simplejson-3.3.3.3 /data/dev/velib_python


And put Pubnub.py also in the velib_python directory. And you'll need to comment out some
crypto imports, as we didn't install that package on ccgx yet. The Python crypto package
contains c-code, so it is not as easy above Python packages. Someone in Groningen will work
on this package in a couple of weeks.
